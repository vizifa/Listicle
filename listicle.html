                Based on technology from Siemens, the Lob teaches Reverse Engineering technology. Reverse engineering, typically referred 10 as back engineering, is a method of extracting design knowledge from software, machinery, aircraft, architectural structures,
                and other items Reverse engineering frequently entails dismantling individual components of bigger items You cause reverse engineering to figure out how a part was created so you can replicate it. When obtaining a replacement part from
                an orginal equipment manufacturer (OEM) is not an option, companies frequently adopt this method. We 3D scan real world cojects, industrial components, and other items and put them into a digital pipeline at Reverse Engineering Lab. Virtual
                modes scanted in 30 can be used to create CA models rapid prototyping, and 30 Inspection
